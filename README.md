## Introduction

This README explains how to compute the probability that a “Quanton Worker” (an economic/trading agent) will choose an action \(i\in\{\mathrm{Buy}, \mathrm{Sell}, \mathrm{Hold}\}\) using a unified, quantum-inspired framework. The formula combines:

1. **Quantum-like belief evolution** via a Hamiltonian \(H_A\).  
2. **Born-rule probabilities** for measurement collapse.  
3. **Contextual weighting** based on real-time market signals.  
4. **Entanglement corrections** to capture cross-agent dependencies.  

The result is a single probabilistic decision rule:

```
P(Action_A = i) = |⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|² ⋅ w_{context}^{(i)} 
                  + ∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|² ⋅ θ_{AB}
```

This README unpacks each term, explains how to implement them in practice, and provides an illustrative toy example.

## Formula Overview

### 1. State Evolution (Unitary Dynamics)

```
U_A(t) |ψ_A(0)⟩
```

- **|ψ_A(0)⟩**: Initial superposition state of agent A (in a 3-dimensional “belief” Hilbert space spanned by \(\{|\,\text{Buy}⟩,|\text{Sell}⟩,|\text{Hold}⟩\}\)).  
- **U_A(t) = exp(-i⋅H_A⋅t)**: Time-evolution operator generated by the Hermitian “economic Hamiltonian” \(H_A\).  

**Interpretation**:  
We model the decision-maker (agent A) as a quantum-like system whose “beliefs” or inclinations start in some superposed state \(|ψ_A(0)⟩\). Over time \(t\), those beliefs evolve under \(U_A(t)\). In a financial context, \(H_A\) might encode how factors like liquidity shocks, changing interest-rate expectations, or volatility signals “push” the trader’s internal state.

---

### 2. Measurement Collapse (Born Rule)

```
|⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|²
```

- **i ∈ {Buy, Sell, Hold}**: Observable outcomes.  
- **Born Rule**: If the state after evolution is \(U_A(t)|ψ_A(0)⟩ = ∑_i a_i(t) |i⟩\), then the probability of collapsing to \(|i⟩\) is \(|a_i(t)|²\).  

**Interpretation**:  
Once the agent’s state has evolved to \(U_A(t)|ψ_A(0)⟩\), you “measure” in the basis \(\{|\,\text{Buy}⟩,|\text{Sell}⟩,|\text{Hold}⟩\}\). The probability of choosing action \(i\) is \(|⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|²\).

---

### 3. Contextual Weighting (Market Observation Influence)

```
w_{context}^{(i)}
```

- **Derived from** a measurement operator  
  ```
  \hat{M}_{context} = ∑_i λ_i |i⟩⟨i|.
  ```
- **λ_i**: Eigenvalue capturing how strongly context favors action \(i\).  
- **w_{context}^{(i)}**: Weight for action \(i\) based on real-time features like news sentiment, volatility, and macro signals.

**Interpretation**:  
After computing the “raw” Born-rule probability \(|⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|²\), multiply by \(w_{context}^{(i)}\) to incorporate market context. Typical choices for \(λ_i\) might involve:

```
λ_{Buy}(t)  = 1 + α ⋅ (Positive Sentiment) - β ⋅ (Volatility Index)
λ_{Sell}(t) = 1 - α ⋅ (Positive Sentiment) + β ⋅ (Volatility Index)
λ_{Hold}(t) = 1
```

Then:

```
P_{context}(A → i) = |⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|² × w_{context}^{(i)},
```

followed by renormalization so that the probabilities sum to 1.

---

### 4. Entanglement Correction (Cross-Agent Feedback)

```
∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|² ⋅ θ_{AB}
```

- **ρ_{AB}(t)**: Joint density matrix for agents A and B (dimension 3×3 by 3×3 in a two-agent case).  
- **|⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|²**: Weight capturing how B’s state \(|j⟩\) influences A’s probability of \(|i⟩\).  
- **θ_{AB}**: Coefficient measuring entanglement/interaction strength between A and B.

**Interpretation**:  
Agents do not act in isolation. The term:

```
∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|² ⋅ θ_{AB}
```

sums over all possible states \(j\) of agent B, quantifying how B’s state impacts A’s likelihood of choosing \(i\). If \(θ_{AB} = 0\), this term vanishes; otherwise, it adds a contextual “nudge” based on B’s correlated state.

---

### Putting It All Together

The final probability that agent A chooses action \(i\) is:

```
P(Action_A = i) = |⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|² ⋅ w_{context}^{(i)}
                  + ∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|² ⋅ θ_{AB}.
```

1. **Unitary evolution** gives baseline quantum-like uncertainty.  
2. **Context weight** rescales these probabilities according to real-time market signals.  
3. **Entanglement correction** adds peer/asset network influences.

Ensure normalization so that \(∑_i P(A → i) = 1\).

---

## Why This Matters

- **Interference Effects**: Unlike classical discrete-choice models (e.g., multinomial logit), quantum-inspired amplitudes can interfere constructively or destructively. A trader simultaneously inclined to Buy and Sell can experience interference, delaying a definitive choice until context resolves the superposition.
- **Context-Adaptive**: By separating “raw” quantum probabilities from contextual reweighting, you only compute the Born-rule distribution once per decision epoch, then apply updated \(w_{context}^{(i)}\) as new market data arrive.
- **Peer-Oriented Feedback**: Real markets feature interdependent agents. Modeling entanglement via \(ρ_{AB}(t)\) captures correlated behaviors, like herding or cascading liquidations.

---

## Practical Considerations

### Specifying the Hamiltonian \(H_A\)

- Choose a Hermitian 3×3 matrix in the basis \(\{|Buy⟩, |Sell⟩, |Hold⟩\}\).  
- Off-diagonal entries \(H_{Buy,Sell}\) can encode transition rates between Sell and Buy sentiments. Diagonal terms reflect baseline propensities or risk aversion.  
- **Calibration**: Fit \(H_A\) to historical order-flow autocorrelations or trader decision logs using maximum-likelihood or Bayesian methods.

---

### Constructing the Context Operator \(\widehat{M}_{context}\)

- For each action \(i\), define a real-valued function \(λ_i(t)\) based on observable market features (e.g., sentiment indices, volatility).  
- Example:

  ```
  λ_{Buy}(t)  = 1 + α ⋅ (S&P 500 sentiment) - β ⋅ (VIX)
  λ_{Sell}(t) = 1 - α ⋅ (S&P 500 sentiment) + β ⋅ (VIX)
  λ_{Hold}(t) = 1
  ```

- Form:

  ```
  \hat{M}_{context} = λ_{Buy} |Buy⟩⟨Buy| 
                      + λ_{Sell} |Sell⟩⟨Sell| 
                      + λ_{Hold} |Hold⟩⟨Hold|.
  ```
- Compute weights:

  ```
  w_{context}^{(i)} = λ_i,
  ```

  then renormalize the “Born × Context” terms.

---

### Building \(ρ_{AB}(t)\)

- **Two-agent case**: \(ρ_{AB}(t)\) is a 9×9 matrix representing joint states of agents A and B.  
- **Large networks**: Directly storing \(ρ_{A_1 A_2 \dots A_N}\) (dimension \(3^N × 3^N\)) is intractable.  
- **Low-rank ansatz**: Approximate

  ```
  ρ_{AB}(t) = ∑_k p_k |φ_k^{(A)}⟩⟨φ_k^{(A)}| ⊗ |ψ_k^{(B)}⟩⟨ψ_k^{(B)}|,
  ```

  with a small number of components \(k\).  
- Compute:

  ```
  ∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|²
  ```

  directly from that ansatz to get the entanglement correction terms.

---

### Normalization Check

After computing:

1. **Born × Context**: \(|⟨i | U_A(t) | ψ_A(0)⟩|² ⋅ w_{context}^{(i)}\)  
2. **Entanglement Correction**: \(∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | i⟩|² ⋅ θ_{AB}\)

Ensure:

```
∑_i P(Action_A = i) = 1.
```

If the sum is not 1, renormalize each \(P(A → i)\) by dividing by the total sum.

---

## Illustrative Example

Suppose at \(t = 0\):

```
|ψ_A(0)⟩ = (1/√3)(|Buy⟩ + |Sell⟩ + |Hold⟩).
```

Let:

```
H_A = [[0, δ, 0],
       [δ, 0, δ],
       [0, δ, 0]]  (in basis {Buy, Sell, Hold}).
```

For a small time \(t = 0.1\), compute:

```
U_A(t) = exp(-i H_A t),
```

and let:

```
U_A(t)|ψ_A(0)⟩ = a_{Buy}(t)|Buy⟩ + a_{Sell}(t)|Sell⟩ + a_{Hold}(t)|Hold⟩.
```

Suppose:

```
|a_{Buy}(t)|²  ≈ 0.35,
|a_{Sell}(t)|² ≈ 0.40,
|a_{Hold}(t)|² ≈ 0.25.
```

Let context weights be:

```
w_{context}^{(Buy)} = 1.2,
w_{context}^{(Sell)} = 0.8,
w_{context}^{(Hold)} = 1.0.
```

Compute “Born × Context”:

```
0.35 × 1.2 = 0.42,
0.40 × 0.8 = 0.32,
0.25 × 1.0 = 0.25,
```

sum = 0.99 → renormalize:

```
P_{Born+Context}(Buy)  ≈ 0.42 / 0.99 ≈ 0.424,
P_{Born+Context}(Sell) ≈ 0.32 / 0.99 ≈ 0.323,
P_{Born+Context}(Hold) ≈ 0.25 / 0.99 ≈ 0.253.
```

Assume agent B’s entanglement yields \(θ_{AB} = 0.05\), and:

```
∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | Buy⟩|²  = 0.20,
∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | Sell⟩|² = 0.15,
∑_j |⟨j | ρ_{AB}(t) | Hold⟩|² = 0.10.
```

Then entanglement corrections:

```
Buy:  0.20 × 0.05 = 0.01,
Sell: 0.15 × 0.05 = 0.0075,
Hold: 0.10 × 0.05 = 0.005.
```

Add these to the “Born+Context” probabilities:

```
P(Buy)  ≈ 0.424 + 0.01  = 0.434,
P(Sell) ≈ 0.323 + 0.0075 = 0.3305,
P(Hold) ≈ 0.253 + 0.005  = 0.258.
```

Sum = 1.0225 → final renormalization:

```
P_final(Buy)  ≈ 0.434 / 1.0225 ≈ 0.4245,
P_final(Sell) ≈ 0.3305 / 1.0225 ≈ 0.3234,
P_final(Hold) ≈ 0.258 / 1.0225 ≈ 0.2521.
```

## Extensions

- **Time-dependent Hamiltonian**: Let \(H_A(t)\) depend explicitly on market observables so that \(U_A(t)\) evolves non-trivially with incoming data.
- **Higher-dimensional action spaces**: Instead of 3 outcomes, use 5 (e.g., “Buy Big,” “Buy Small,” “Hold,” “Sell Small,” “Sell Big”), resulting in a 5D Hilbert space.
- **Network approximations**: For large N, approximate \(ρ\) using only pairwise blocks or low-rank decompositions to maintain tractability.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Numerical Implementation**: Write code (Python/Matlab) to diagonalize toy Hamiltonians, compute \(U_A(t)\), and walk through Born+Context+Entanglement steps.  
2. **Calibration**: Use historical trade/quote data to fit parameters \(H_A\), \(λ_i(t)\), and \(θ_{AB}\) via maximum likelihood.  
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Explore how changing \(θ_{AB}\) from 0 to large values amplifies or dampens cross-agent correlations.
